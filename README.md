# WindBNB

In this project I created a small version of Airbnb - Windbnb with a given data. I used React to handle the front end.

-   We can see a list of properties
-   We can see property card with a name, rating, apartment type, and super host
-   We can open filter drawer
-   We can filter properties by location and number of guests
-   We can see the number of filtered items
